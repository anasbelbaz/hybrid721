# Dao ERC721 Configurator

This project demonstrates a basic ERC721 use case. It comes with a sample contract, tests for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and code sample to interact with the contract using js and ethers library.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat clean

npx hardhat test
npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network NETWORK_NAME
npx hardhat verify --constructor-args scripts/arguments.js CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
